How to Play


--------------- Menu and Cardbuilding ---------------
-The game features deck building, a single-player mode, and card builder
-You can choose to dive in and "Play" right away with a default deck
-You can also choose to create your own deck by clicking the "decks" menu
-In the Deck Builder, you can choose also to create your own card. Assign "points" to your creature's attack and health with the buttons on the right. You can obtain more "points" by increasing the card's cost.
*Make sure to restart the game after creating a card to see your creation in the card list*
** Please make any cards before creating your deck. You may not be able to edit decks after saving **
-Returning to the play menu, you can find your deck in the settings menu. Choose a deck for yourself and your opponent and play the game!


--------------- Gameplay ---------------
-The goal of the game is to reduce your opponent's life to 0 before yours do
-You can do this by playing "creatures" or "spells"
	- Creatures persist on the game board until destroyed. They have an attack value to reduce others' health, and its own health value. Once this is reduced to 0, the creature is destroyed
	- Spells have immediate effects on the game when played. However, many of them affect the state of the game but not the board directly. Use them to buff up your creatures, increase your mana, and other effects!

All cards have a "cost" on the top left corner. This cost essentially indicates the "power level" of a card - the higher the strength, the higher the cost. You can see how much mana you have at the bottom right of the screen. This value increases each of your turns until it reaches 10. It also refreshes at each turn.

At the start of each turn, you will draw a card. Defeat your opponent before you run out! 
*There is a 30 second timer for your turns. Don't think for too long!*



---------------Currently Known Issues---------------
-Decks are not editable after saving. You can find them in the "play" menu, however, they do not show up as an editable deck in the Deckbuilder. 
-Overlay during the game win/game loss screen is on the wrong order. The pop-up is still interactable, but displays behind existing creatures. 
-Game requires game restart to see newly created cards.
